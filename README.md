# Roblox-daily-accessory-adder
Adds an item everyday that you can pick to your Roblox avatar. Works best with shirts and pants.

# Getting started
Add a .env file in your workspace and in the file put:
```
TZ = ""
RBLXCOOKIE = ""
```
For TZ put your timezone in. Ex. America/Chicago
For RBLXCOOKIE put in your Roblox Cookie. Most people don't know how to get this so here is an example how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v3inNUxyL8

## Notes
Make sure that you never share your roblox cookie to anyone. Sharing it would let them access your account without a password.
